# Software Development and Problem Solving  
## Project Proposal  
### Baked by Aisha – Company Website  

---

### 1. The Big Idea  
The goal of this project is to develop a website for my baking business, Baked By Aisha, based in Houston, Texas. This website will help showcase products, display pricing, and enable interaction with customers.  

**Explored Topics and Objectives:**  
I will explore web application development, focusing on backend development with FastAPI, API creation, database integration, and frontend design using HTML/CSS or React.

**Minimum Viable Product (MVP):**  
The MVP will include the basic functionality of displaying product listings and prices from a connected database, allowing visitors to view available items and pricing information.

**Stretch Goal:**  
In addition to the MVP, I aim to include:
- An interactive feedback/order form to facilitate customer inquiries and orders.
- An embedded Instagram feed to showcase recent product photos, adding visual appeal and engaging visitors.

### 2. Learning Objectives  
My learning objectives include:
- **Backend Development with FastAPI:** Gain hands-on experience in routing, API creation, and database connections.
- **Frontend Development with HTML/CSS or React:** Build a visually appealing and functional frontend that integrates seamlessly with the backend.
- **Full-Stack Development:** Understand the workflow between frontend and backend components, focusing on delivering a cohesive product.

### 3. Implementation Plan  
- **Frontend Framework:** Start with HTML/CSS and transition to React if time allows, enhancing responsiveness and interactivity.
- **Backend Framework:** Use FastAPI with Python as the primary programming language for managing routing, API endpoints, and database interaction.
- **Database Selection:** Explore MongoDB for its simplicity and suitability for small business needs.
- **API Integration with Instagram:** To display Instagram posts, I’ll look into using Instagram’s API or embedding posts directly on the site.
- **Research:** Begin with documentation for FastAPI, HTML/CSS, React (if applicable), and Instagram’s API to ensure effective project execution.

---

### 4. Project Schedule  
- **Week 1:** Research and setup (environment setup, review FastAPI and HTML/CSS/React documentation).
- **Week 2:** Backend setup and initial frontend design (establish FastAPI routes, build database models, and prototype frontend structure).
- **Week 3:** Database integration with frontend and backend (connect product listings to the frontend, test data retrieval).
- **Week 4:** Finalize MVP features and start implementing stretch goals (add feedback form and Instagram posts).
- **Week 5:** Testing, debugging, and deployment preparation.

### 5. Collaboration Plan  
Although this is an independent project, I’ll approach it with a structured workflow for efficient development. I’ll use Git and GitHub for version control, documenting each feature addition to maintain a clear record. To stay organized, I’ll break down the project into tasks aligned with my project schedule and manage them using Trello or GitHub Projects. Each task will have clear goals, deadlines, and testing requirements, focusing on iterative development and treating each phase as a “sprint,” similar to agile methodologies.

To replicate the collaborative benefits of a team project, I’ll seek feedback from peers and mentors after completing major milestones, ensuring I stay aligned with user experience best practices. I’ll document features and testing outcomes at each stage, providing a solid foundation for future updates and adaptability to challenges or improvements.

### 6. Risks and Limitations  
- **Time Constraints:** Balancing feature completeness with the project timeline.
- **API Integration with Instagram:** Potential limitations or restrictions with Instagram’s API that could affect embedding posts.
- **Database Complexity:** Ensuring efficient database queries to avoid latency in product display.

### 7. Additional Course Content  
Are there any course topics or content you think would be helpful for your project?  
Content on managing API integrations or deploying web applications could be beneficial. Learning about database optimization or caching mechanisms might also help ensure smooth performance.
